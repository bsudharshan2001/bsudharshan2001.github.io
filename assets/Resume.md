## Projects

### Development of CADRADs Prediction System
**Jun 2024 - Present**

- Spearheaded the development of CCTA-RADS, the largest publicly available dataset of 940 real-world Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) reports from Tampa General Hospital, annotated with expert-verified CAD-RADS scores under IRB approval.
- Lead a multi-disciplinary collaboration with Prof. Ning Wang (USF SPRAI Lab), Dr. Zhiyu Liu, Dr. Shone Almeida, and Dr. Mathew Karvelil (USF Morsani College of Medicine) to address linguistic and structural heterogeneity in clinical text
- Designed an end-to-end two-stage Clinical NLP pipeline for automated CAD-RADS scoring, integrating an LLM-based report parser (ChatGPT-4o-mini, Mistral DocAI, GPT-4.1) that normalizes free-text reports with fine-tuned BERT-family classifiers (BioBERT, ClinicalBERT) trained on structured JSON data
- Achieved a 90.12% F1-score with BioBERT, surpassing direct LLM prompting and raw-text fine-tuning methods, while improving classification of clinically critical CAD-RADS classes (3-4) and non-diagnostic cases (N).
- Developed a HIPAA-compliant text-processing and data sanitization pipeline to ensure secure report handling and consistent terminology standardization across all training stages.
- Integrated explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) for model interpretability, enabling visualization of key sections influencing each prediction to enhance clinical transparency and trust.
- Deployed the trained model as a web-based clinical decision-support tool, allowing radiologists to upload de-identified reports for automated scoring with interpretability visualizations
- Funded by USF Morsani College of Medicine through Graduate Medical Education Fund: $5000
- Publishing research as a paper - "Learning from Textual Radiology Reports: A Benchmark Dataset for Coronary CT Angiography" - Under review at EACL 2025

### Crowd Counting Using Wi-Fi CSI
**May 2022 - Jun 2023**

- Developed an innovative solution for crowd estimation utilizing Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI), aiming to overcome limitations in accuracy, scalability, cost and privacy encroachment in traditional methods.
- Deployed ESP32 microcontrollers to design and execute controlled experiments, collecting custom CSI datasets across varying room configurations (8ft x 8ft and 10ft x 10ft) and occupancy levels (1-6 people) to address data scarcity challenges
- Applied advanced data augmentation techniques to account for environmental variability in CSI data, exploring calibration and synthetic enrichment strategies to improve training dataset robustness
- Implemented and trained neural networks using TensorFlow, Keras and Scikit-learn to process and analyze Wi-Fi CSI data

### Development of Generic Mitigation systems against ransomware
**Apr 2022 - Dec 2022**

- Project funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India under Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
- Developed a robust analysis test-bed to effectively monitor the run-time behavior of ransomware
- Created a standardized ransomware dataset alongside ransomware behavior model to develop a generic ransomware mitigation system.

### Varuna - Cyclone Intensity Estimation Dashboard
**Feb 2022 - Mar 2022**

- Designed and developed a Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation web application using CNN-based architectures (R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO) in Flutter, leveraging half-hourly INSAT-3D IR satellite imagery
- Implemented an automated data-fetching pipeline to regularly retrieve images from the IMD website (in the absence of an API) for real-time model inference. Built and presented as part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2022) organized by the Government of India.

### Civitas - Community Management App
**Sep 2021 - Oct 2021**
